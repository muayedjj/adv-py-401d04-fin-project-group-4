- **How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**
  - Every person on your team is an asset, and we hereby commit to doing our
  best to make sure each one of us fits in their role and do what they feel they
  do best in order to maximize productivity and team harmony while minimizing fatigue.
- **In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**
  - We all agree that we want to make our best to develop in the python field. Since
  we are all new to this field we want to get the best to do the libraries
- **Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project,
how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**
  - We have scheduled daily meetings accommodating all our schedules and
  we plan on using trello to manage our workflow and problem solving 
  cooperation efforts.

## Conflict Plan

- **What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**
  - Identifying points of agreement and disagreement, working on conflicts
  one by one.
  - Compartmentalization.
  - Dividing the tasks amongst teammembers appropriately.
  - Assigning people more work in the event that a teammember is
  unable to meet their timeplan.
- **What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting
the other members contribute?**
  - The first step would be to address the issue professionally in a closed team meeting.
  - If that effort doesn't bear fruit, outside assistance would be requested from
  the instructional staff and people of experience.
- **How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing
that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding
and skill level?**
  - The tasks will be divided on what we agree is the key strength for each person,
  and the problems will work on them together
- **How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**
  - Privately through the teamleader first, or through team meetings
  clarifying team values and needs.
  - Making it clear that this is an opportunity to gain mutual experiences from
  each other to reach the main goal and complete the project
- **How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**
  - It is rare to have such case
  - However, if this happened then the best practice would be to reach out our Instructor
  or one of the TA\s each member will address it in his own words
  - and we will find the best solution that serves our project goals and vision.
